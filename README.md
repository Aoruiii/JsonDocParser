## Overview                                                                                                                        

This application reads and deserializes video game data  from a JSON file. It is robust and should not crash under any circumstances. Any unhandled exceptions are written to the log file.

## Main application workflow    

| When the application starts, it shall print:                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Enter the name of the file you want to read:                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| The user must enter the name of an existing file. The app should keep asking the user to enter the file until the valid name is entered. See **Entering the file name by the user** for more details. |                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Next, the app tries to read the video game data from the given file. See **Reading the data from the JSON file.**                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| The file contains valid JSON                                                                                                                                                                          | The file does not contain valid JSON                                                                                                                                                        |

| Video games read from the file are printed to the screen. See **Printing video games.**                                                                                                               | “JSON in the **FILE_NAME** was not in a valid format. JSON body:” is printed to the console in red, followed by the contents of the JSON file.                                              |
|                                                                                                                                                                                                       | “Sorry! The application has experienced an unexpected error and will have to be closed.” is printed.                                                                                        |
|                                                                                                                                                                                                       | A new entry is added to the log file, containing the date and time of the exception, the exception message, and the stack trace. See **Logging exceptions in a file** for more information. |
| Finally, the app prints “Press any key to close.” and after that, the window closes.                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                             |

## Entering the file name by the user

| Scenario                 | User action                                                                                | Result                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sunny day                | User enters a file name that is not null and not empty, and file with such a name exists.  | The app moves on to the next step - **Reading the data from the JSON file.**                                                                                            |
| Null input               | The user presses CTRL+Z in the console.                                                    | “File name cannot be null.” is printed to the console. Then, the user is asked again to enter the file name. It is repeated until the user provides the correct input.  |
| Empty input              | The user enters an empty file path.                                                        | “File name cannot be empty.” is printed to the console. Then, the user is asked again to enter the file name. It is repeated until the user provides the correct input. |
| No file with such a name | The user enters a valid file name, but such a file does not exist.                         | “File not found.” is printed to the console. Then, the user is asked again to enter the file name. It is repeated until the user provides the correct input.            |

## Reading the data from the JSON file

We, as the developers of this app, do not create the JSON files ourselves. We can imagine we read them from the web, or from some database. We must create our code in such a way, that it can handle the given files.

An example of a valid file can be found here: **~[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xfSqAdaNglliZqgi-q1Tune8G500mVCo/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xfSqAdaNglliZqgi-q1Tune8G500mVCo/view?usp=sharing)~**
